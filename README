NEWS

Supports mod_perl and has a nifty debugger.
Macro names no longer must be on word boundaries, but still are by default.
Style xml renames sgml.
Various bugs corrected.
Useful file examples/cgi-test.phtml added.

This is still alpha beacause there is no Makefile.pl and line numbers of error
messages are grossly misleading.  But the documented features are well tested.


DESCRIPTION

Perl-programmes may contain bits of string to be output, whereas inversely
iPerl-documents consist of any kind of text to be output, and bits of
specially marked Perl that control the document with conditionals or loops
spanning text, subdocument-includes and macro definitions.  This is comparable
to, yet far more powerful than the C preprocessor or the m4 macro processor,
but can also be seen as a template-mechanism.

How you mark Perl depends on you taste.  Various styles are available
including those of the two above-mentioned preprocessors.  Not only is there
also a style for bringing PODs alive, but it can also strip them from a
document allowing you to document anything with POD.


INSTALLATION

Copy Text/iPerl.pm to the Text subdirectory in one of the directories shown as
@INC in the output of perl -V.

Copy bin/iPerl to some directory shown by echo $PATH.

Copy lisp/iPerl.elc to some directory shown by Emacs with F1 v load-path,
preferably one ending in site-lisp.

Copy cgi-bin/web-iPerl to the perl or cgi-bin directory of your web-server and
instruct it to pass files with a special ending (e.g. *.phtml) to that script.
For Apache this can be achieved by putting into conf/httpd.conf the following
lines:

  AddType application/x-web-iPerl phtml psgml pxml ptxt putxt pps
  AddType application/x-web-iPerl pht psg pxm ptx put
  DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.phtml index.pht

For mod_perl operation:

  Action application/x-web-iPerl /perl/web-iPerl

For CGI operation:

  Action application/x-web-iPerl /cgi-bin/web-iPerl

For NPH operation (requires renaming script):

  Action application/x-web-iPerl /cgi-bin/nph-iPerl

For further information extract the documentation with pod2text or pod2html
from the three files or study the examples.  The doc can also be read on the
web-site.
