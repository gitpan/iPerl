=head1 NAME

storyfun.ptxt - template fill-in story


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  iperl storyfun.ptxt

or

  iperl storyfun.ptxt </dev/null


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bits of Perl in this document are marked up in bang style.

A certain number of words in a little story have been left open.  For each
missing word a default is randomly selected by category and you are prompted
for your choice.  These are then interpolated into the story by means of
C<!E<lt>...E<gt>!>.  All three variants are used:  an empty one for $_,
integers as indexes into @_ and Perl expressions.


=head1 CREDITS

Inspired by an April 2000 L<http://www.sysadminmag.com/> article by Randal
L. Schwartz, (see L<http://www.rahul.net/jeffrey/> for his ongoing scary
story) in turn based on L<http://www.mit.edu/storyfun/list>.

}!I went for a walk

Yesterday, I went out walking, and somehow ended up in !<$place>!.  I saw
!<$plants>! and !<$animals>! -- it was !<0>!!  But I started getting
!<>! hungry, and needed to find my way home.  But no matter where I
!<$verb_past>!, I couldn't see the path.  I decided to go around the !<3>!
!<$noun>! up ahead, and discovered that it led back home!  I was !<$verb_ed>!.
At dinner, when I told my !<2>! story, my !<$nouns>! looked at me with !<1>!
expressions.  Then they forbade me from ever !<$verb_ing>! again.
