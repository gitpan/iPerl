This is iPerl (inverse Perl) version 0.5

Info and latest version are at http://beam.to/iPerl/

This is still alpha beacause there is no Makefile.pl and line numbers of error
messages are grossly misleading.  But the documented features are well tested.


INSTALLATION

Copy Text/iPerl.pm to the Text subdirectory in one of the directories shown as
@INC in the output of perl -V.

Copy bin/iPerl to some directory shown by echo $PATH.

Copy lisp/iPerl.elc to some directory shown by Emacs with F1 v load-path,
preferably one ending in site-lisp.

Copy cgi-bin/web-iPerl to the cgi-bin directory of your web-server and
instruct it to pass files with a special ending (e.g. *.phtml) to that script.
For Apache this can be achieved by putting into conf/httpd.conf the following
lines:

  AddType application/x-web-iPerl phtml psgml pxml ptxt putxt pps
  AddType application/x-web-iPerl pht psg pxm ptx put
  Action application/x-web-iPerl /cgi-bin/web-iPerl

  DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.phtml index.pht

For further information extract the documentation with pod2text or pod2html
from the three files or study the examples.  The doc can also be read on the
web-site.
